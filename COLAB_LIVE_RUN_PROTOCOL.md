# Colab Free-Tier Run

Use this checklist for the live free-tier run.

## Open

Main notebook:

`notebooks/Choi_Whisoo_SPIX_spatial_clustering_SVG_CCI_colab.ipynb`

Colab URL:

`https://colab.research.google.com/github/whistle-ch0i/spix-colab-workshop/blob/main/notebooks/Choi_Whisoo_SPIX_spatial_clustering_SVG_CCI_colab.ipynb`

Data URL:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whistle-ch0i/spix-colab-workshop/main/data/visiumhd_colon_crc_p2_square016um_markerdiverse_roi_10000x2500.h5ad`

## Run

1. Open the Colab URL with a free-tier Google account.
2. Select `Runtime > Disconnect and delete runtime`.
3. Select `Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator: None`.
4. Run all cells.
5. Keep the downloaded `choi_whisoo_colab_timing_report.json`.

For a clean free-tier check, do not use Pro, Pro+, Pay As You Go compute units,
or an enterprise runtime.

## Pass Criteria

- `runtime.running_in_colab` is `true`.
- `runtime.thread_cap` is `2`.
- `validation_passed` is `true`.
- All four sections complete:
  - SPIX multiscale segmentation,
  - spatial clustering,
  - multiscale SVG,
  - segment-level spatial LR scoring.
- The final report contains stage timings.
- Total time is acceptable for the workshop slot.

## Local Baseline

Local low-resource run on 2026-07-05:

- Code cells: 13/13 passed.
- Dataset: `10000 x 2515`.
- Total elapsed: 28.60 seconds after local dependencies and data were available.
- Slowest stages:
  - multiscale SVG Moran: 7.95 seconds.
  - CCI segment-level scoring: 6.89 seconds.
  - SPIX embedding/image cache: 6.79 seconds.
- Segment counts:
  - `r48`: 1138
  - `r96`: 285
  - `r192`: 68
  - `r384`: 21

Colab will usually be slower because it has to install packages and download the
data on a fresh runtime.
